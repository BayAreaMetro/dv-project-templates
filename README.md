## Purpose

## Getting Started 

### GitHub

[10-minute introduction](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to GitHub.  

### Markdown

[3-Minute Markdown introduction](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

If you have any questions about how to use GitHub for D&V projects please contact Tom Buckley.  

### Documentation

We've used the following structure for a [number of projects](#examples). We are open to changing it and developing new templates.

To get started with this template, you can copy and paste the text below into a markdown document. 

```

The `##` tags above are rendered as headers in [Markdown](#Markdown)  

### Examples

Example applications of the methodology:

- [cartographic](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/motm) focus
- a [statutory requirement analysis](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/tpp_ceqa_map_for_pba_17) 
- [transit analysis](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/RegionalTransitDatabase/blob/master/docs/transit_priority_areas.md) 
- [data processing and string matching](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/vital-signs-traffic-data)
- various [ad-hoc spatial analysis](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/Adhoc-Spatial-Analysis).      

### Draft Status  

In the future, we would like to mark projects with *Draft* at the top, until they have been reviewed by the relevant audience. Once they have been reviewed, we can mark them *Final*.
