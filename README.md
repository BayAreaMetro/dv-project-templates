# dv-project-templates
Recipes for project documentation maintained by Data &amp; Visualization

## Goal 

The goal of this repository is to collect great examples of project documentation. 

## Analysis Projects

[ANALYSIS-SIMPLE.md](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/dv-project-templates/blob/master/ANALYSIS-SIMPLE.md) contains a list of headers we have used to structure the documentation of analytical projects. Some examples of projects using this structure can be found [here](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/motm) and [here](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/Adhoc-Spatial-Analysis). Raw text (for copy and paste) of that file is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BayAreaMetro/dv-project-templates/master/ANALYSIS-SIMPLE.md)

[ANALYSIS-DETAILED.md](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/dv-project-templates/blob/master/ANALYSIS-DETAILED.md) describes how to use the headers above in more detail.
