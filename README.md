### Analysis

We've used the following template for projects with a [cartographic](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/motm) focus, a [statutory requirement analysis](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/tpp_ceqa_map_for_pba_17), [transit analysis](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/RegionalTransitDatabase/blob/master/docs/transit_priority_areas.md), and various [ad-hoc spatial analysis](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/Adhoc-Spatial-Analysis).    

- [ANALYSIS-SIMPLE.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BayAreaMetro/dv-project-templates/master/ANALYSIS-SIMPLE.md) contains a list of headers that can be copied and pasted into a new markdown document for a project. 
- [ANALYSIS-DETAILED.md](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/dv-project-templates/blob/master/ANALYSIS-DETAILED.md) describes how to use the headers above in more detail.
